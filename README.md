## Directions

### Step #1 - Use a variable for the x position <br>

In this challenge, you'll use your knowledge about `while` loops to fill the canvas with a beautiful landscape. As a first step, make a new variable and use it for the `x position` of the flower and balloon emoji.
<br><br>
_Hint:_
<br>
`var XXX = 0;`<br>
` text("ðŸŒ¼", XXX, 340);`<br>
` text("ðŸŽˆ", XXX, 200);`
<br><br>

### Step #2 - Use a while loop to change the x position <br>

You're ready to create your landscape. Use a while loop to draw flowers and balloons across the canvas, from left to right:

- Start off by making a while loop that draws the flower and the balloon;
- Make sure your variable starts close to the left edge of the canvas;
- Increment the variable, so that each flower and balloon is drawn close to the last;
- It should keep drawing while the x position variable is inside the canvas;

_Hint:_
<br>
`var XXX = 0;`<br>
`while (XXX < XXX) {`<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;` text("ðŸŒ¼", XXX, 340);`<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;` text("ðŸŽˆ", XXX, 200);`<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;` XXX += ###;` <br>
`}`
